## What is this repository about?

This repository is for those who are getting started into the open-source world.\
You can quickly make your first contribution in open-source and get a green square! ðŸŽ‰

## That sounds awesome! What should I do to contribute?

- Fork the current repository you're on.
  - Don't know how to fork a repository? Refer to [**this article**](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
- Make a new branch
  - Don't know how to make a branch? Refer to [**this article**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
- Add your project in the `projects-list.md` file.
  - For example: if I want to add one of my projects, I would add it like this

```markdown
- [Cloud Items](https://github.com/minetest-mods/cloud_items) - Made by [David Leal](https://github.com/Panquesito7)
```

- Make a pull request to add your project to the list.

## I do not have any repository to add. What should I do?

Do you have any project saved in your computer that can be useful to others?\
Let us know if you need any help creating the repository and adding it!

Otherwise, this is a very good repository to make your first open-source contribution.\
Here you don't have to add projects: you will have to add your name in alphabetical order instead.
